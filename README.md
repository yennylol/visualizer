Using Phineas's [lanyard](https://github.com/Phineas/lanyard) websocket and REST API, you can see your live [Discord](https://discord.com/) status, information and activities right in your browser!  
You can use this on your own website, as a subpage to display your live [Discord](https://discord.com/) status.

Everything you need to edit is in the ``config.js``.

Please feel free to leave a PR or an issue, to try to keep this project as customisable and clean as possible!
